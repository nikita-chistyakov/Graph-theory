# Graph Theory and Knowledge Networks

## Graph Theory Fundamentals

Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relationships between objects. In a graph:

- **Nodes** (or vertices) represent objects or entities
- **Edges** represent connections or relationships between nodes

## Applications in Knowledge Management

Graph theory helps to identify:
- Clusters of related information
- Orphan nodes (isolated notes with no links)
- Central hubs within a knowledge base

## Real-World Example

**Obsidian** is a note-taking application that uses graph visualization to display relationships between notes:
- Each note functions as a node in the graph
- Links between notes appear as edges
- The resulting network visualization helps users understand connections within their knowledge base

## Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs extend these concepts by focusing on the semantic meaning of networks:
- They represent facts as nodes
- Relationships between facts are represented as edges
- This structure enables complex querying and inference across interconnected data

Knowledge graphs are foundational to modern information systems, semantic web technologies, and artificial intelligence applications.
